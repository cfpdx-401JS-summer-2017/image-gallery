Add a backend server for your image gallery app:
* Create a separate `server` repo (does not need to be a fork of lab)
* Organize your project so that it can run in both "dev" mode and "build" to server.
* Introduce `services` into your app
  * common module for core http ajax
  * service module for images
* Integrate service calls intro your components

## Bonus

* Create container components (either static or `withImages` style)

## Rubric *10pts*
- Separate server and app with dev and build modes *5pts*
- Services modules *3pts*
- Use services in app *3pts*
